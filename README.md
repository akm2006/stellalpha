## üëã Welcome to Stellalpha

This project allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, follow **"Star Traders"**, and have the Stellalpha agent automatically replicate their trades **gaslessly**.  

It also includes a powerful **on-chain AI assistant** that can perform wallet operations through natural language commands, making blockchain interactions as simple as chatting.  


---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
This project is for **Hackathon and development purposes only**.  

- The production-ready implementation will use **0xGasless Smart Accounts**, which do not require user private keys.  
- Users will fund their smart accounts, and the app will interact only with the smart wallet.  

For **testing and development**, we currently use:
- **EOA (Externally Owned Accounts)**  
- **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**  

Although the app can be run on **Avalanche Mainnet** by changing the `CHAIN_ID` and `RPC_URL` in `.env`, it is **strongly discouraged** to use your real private key.  

üëâ Any use of your **Mainnet private key** is entirely at your own risk.  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the **0xGasless Agent** can power an autonomous trading agent.  

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Autonomous Copy-Trading**: Monitor and replicate trades from Star Traders on supported DEXs. Backend watches the chain 24/7.  
- **Gasless Transactions**: Powered by **0xGasless AgentKit**, trades execute without requiring native tokens (e.g., AVAX) for gas fees.  
- **Interactive AI Assistant**: A chatbot that can check balances, transfer tokens, and perform swaps via natural language.  
- **Live Activity Feed**: Real-time logs of all agent-executed trades for transparency.  
- **Multi-DEX Support**: Easily configurable to monitor and trade on multiple DEXs. See the **DEX Configuration Guide**.  
- **Portfolio Management**: Manage holdings, configure followed traders, and customize trade amounts.  
- **Modern UI**: Dark theme + glassmorphism, built with **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**.

## üöÄ [Getting Started](#-guides--tutorials)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)  
- npm or yarn  
- MetaMask wallet  

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akm2006/stellalpha.git
cd stellalpha
npm install
````

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder and add the following:

```env
# Avalanche RPC (Fuji or Mainnet)
AVALANCHE_RPC_URL="YOUR_AVAX_RPC_URL"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AVALANCHE_RPC_URL="YOUR_AVAX_RPC_URL"

# 0xGasless API Key
OXGASLESS_API_KEY="YOUR_0XGASLESS_API_KEY"

# OpenRouter AI API Key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

# Network (43113 = Fuji, 43114 = Mainnet)
CHAIN_ID="43113"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID="43113"

# Upstash Redis
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="YOUR_UPSTASH_URL"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="YOUR_UPSTASH_TOKEN"
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üìã Development Logs

When running locally, the terminal (with `npm run dev`) will display detailed logs for both frontend and backend API routes.

Key logs to watch for:

* `[Chat API] Loaded X tools for the agent.` ‚Üí Confirms AI agent initialized correctly.
* `Scanning Fuji block #...` ‚Üí Block listener is active.
* `üî•üî•üî• Matched transaction from Star wallet: ...` ‚Üí Detected trader transaction.
* `üöÄ Triggering autonomous copy-trade for user ...` ‚Üí Preparing to trade.
* `‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Gasless copy-trade EXECUTED! ...` ‚Üí Successful trade execution.

---

## üåê Mainnet Usage

This app is **Mainnet-ready**, but only recommended for **testing with burner wallets**.

To switch from Fuji Testnet to Avalanche Mainnet, update `.env.local`:

```env
CHAIN_ID=43114
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=43114
AVALANCHE_RPC_URL=YOUR_AVALANCHE_MAINNET_RPC_URL
```

---

## üîí Security Warning: Private Key Usage

To enable autonomous features, this app requires your wallet‚Äôs private key.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Guidelines:**

* NEVER use your primary wallet or one with significant funds.
* ALWAYS use a dedicated burner wallet.
* While the private key is not stored permanently, sending it to a backend service is inherently risky.

üëâ You are solely responsible for the **security of your keys and funds**.
