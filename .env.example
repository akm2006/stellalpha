the content is now much smaller i want to use the sames sizes as the demo-vault page , i just wanted you to adjust the gaps to fit the content which was going out of the screen also replace the roi with profit factor the top roi field will have a i button hovering it will explain what it is in a user friendly way . Read this note :[ Here is the breakdown of the metrics and the best strategy for your situation:1. Is Profit Factor the best alternative to ROI?Yes. Since you cannot easily calculate time-weighted ROI, Profit Factor (PF) is the industry-standard "Gold Metric" for efficiency.What it measures: For every $1 lost, how many $ were gained?Why it's better than Win Rate: A trader can have a 90% Win Rate (winning small pennies) but lose it all in one bad trade (blowing up). Profit Factor catches this. If they lose big, their PF drops below 1.0.The Formula: Total Gross Profit ($) / Total Gross Loss ($).Note: You need the sum of all winning trades ($) and sum of all losing trades ($), not just the counts.2. Is "Total Realized PNL" a bad way to rank?Yes, it is dangerous.The "Whale Bias": If you rank by Total PNL, a rich user with **$1,000,000** who makes a lazy 1% profit (+$10k) will rank higher than a genius trader with **$1,000** who makes 500% profit (+$5k).The Consequence: Your users will copy "rich" traders instead of "skilled" traders, which is not what they want. The Solution: Rank by "Profit Factor" (with a Filter)I recommend ranking by Profit Factor descending, but you MUST apply a "Minimum Trade Count" filter (e.g., > 10 trades).Why filter? Without a filter, a lucky user who made 1 trade and won $5 (and lost $0) will have a Profit Factor of Infinity and top the leaderboard.]
